/**
 * Makes a snapshot of a feed in a SQL database. Effectively this is copying all of the tables for a given feed (which
 * all exist in a single schema, e.g., abcd_efghijklmnopqurstu.stops) into a new feed/schema namespace.
 *
 * As far as the logic for managing snapshots in the GTFS editor, here is the basic model we follow, along with some
 * ideas for future optimizations to make things quicker for large feeds (which can take a minute or two to copy all of
 * the tables -- unfortunately there is nothing in the world of RDBMS that allows for copying tables with records and
 * indexes on those records fully intact):
 *
 * 1. User uploads a GTFS zip file as a feed version.
 * 2. User loads that feed version into editor. This initializes a CreateSnapshotJob to create the first working buffer.
 *    Also, the editorNamespace field is updated to this first buffer namespace (abcd_).
 * 3. User makes edits, deletes a route, adds stops etc.
 *
 *  TODO: In the future, we could copy on write to add individual tables as they are edited and piece together a feed.
 *
 * 4. User makes a new snapshot to save her work. This initializes another CreateSnapshotJob to snapshot the buffer
 *    (abcd_). Operationally what happens is that the tables are copied to a new namespace (lmno_) and the new namespace
 *    becomes the working buffer.
 * 5. More edits... and, oops, we just deleted everything.
 * 6. User needs to restore abcd_, so we make a snapshot of abcd_ (as naamespace wxyz_), which becomes the new working
 *    buffer. If the user chooses, she can delete lmno_. Otherwise it just stays as a snapshot that the pointer has
 *    moved away from.
 *
 * I think how I had been thinking about this at one point was that the newly created tables were the "snapshot," but
 * actually in this model the namespace being copied becomes the immutable "snapshot" and the buffer is the new
 * namespace.
 *
 *        2.                                4.
